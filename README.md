# FantasyLine

**FantasyLine** is a Streamlit application that generates and displays **PPR fantasy football projections** for skill position players.  

The system leverages **sportsbook betting odds** and player prop lines, converts them into **implied probabilities**, and integrates them into a single **total projection** for each player. These projections are then presented in a simple, interactive dashboard.

## Data format

FantasyLine expects the following columns in its weekly data file:

| Column             | Type   | Description                               |
|--------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Player`           | string | Player full name                          |
| `Team`             | string | Team code (e.g., KC, BUF)                 |
| `Pos`              | string | Player position (RB, WR, TE)              |
| `Base_Projection`  | float  | Projection from primary prop markets       |
| `Proj TD PTS`      | float  | Contribution from touchdown probability    |
| `Total_Projection` | float  | Combined fantasy projection                |

The CSV should be updated weekly with the latest sportsbook data.

## Methodology

FantasyLine projections are generated by translating sportsbook odds into implied probabilities, then integrating these probabilities with prop lines (e.g., rushing, receiving, touchdowns). These components are combined into a total projection that reflects expected **PPR fantasy points**.  

This framework ensures that projections are directly informed by real betting market data while remaining flexible for weekly updates.
